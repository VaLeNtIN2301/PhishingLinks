**Loading Image Scam**

> How does it work? The attack, in fact, works in a much more simple way than many people imagine. Like all phishing attacks it eventually relies on you, the user, believeing that you are accessing a site you’re not. The attack works as follows:
> 
> A user posts a link to an image in a server.
> 
> The image displays a never-ending loading indicator.
> 
> The user clicks on the image, and clicks to open it in their browser.
> 
> The user is redirected to a phishing page.
