**What are phishing links?**
Usually it's a fake login page where they trick you into entering your account data so they can steal your account. They can use your account later to SPAM all your friends, sell it or buy Nitro gifts using the attached card (if exists).

> Even if it’s from a friend, you should not trust any random links or add your log-in information to any unfamiliar sites. Doing so will cause you to lose control of your own account and put other users at risk. Common “phishing” links include fake nitro gifts, fake steam profile links, and a “game” which the hacked user wants you to test. The links can also include typos to look as close to a real link as possible.

**Fake Community Programs Invitation**

> You were randomly selectected to join HypeSquad Events or your community has been selected for the Partner program without even applying?

**Loading Image Scam**

> How does it work? The attack, in fact, works in a much more simple way than many people imagine. Like all phishing attacks it eventually relies on you, the user, believeing that you are accessing a site you’re not. The attack works as follows:
> A user posts a link to an image in a server.
> The image displays a never-ending loading indicator.
> The user clicks on the image, and clicks to open it in their browser.
> The user is redirected to a phishing page.

**How to avoid them?**

> You can use auto-moderation systems that use known APIs to detect bad domains & phishing links. Here are some examples: [CrossLink](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=742711687777484871&permissions=103348038854&scope=bot%20applications.commands), [SafeLink](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=819742627032596480&permissions=268725318&scope=bot+applications.commands), [AutoModerator](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=847081327950168104&permissions=83968&scope=applications.commands%20bot), [Dyno](discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=161660517914509312&scope=bot%20identify%20guilds%20applications.commands&response_type=code&permissions=2134207679), [Waifu](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=434556304661544960&scope=bot+applications.commands&permissions=403041526), [GiselleBot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=356831787445387285&permissions=813034742&scope=bot), [Fish 🐟](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=892420397570592768&scope=bot%20applications.commands&permissions=268446726). Keep in mind that there are new phishing domains every hour and not all bad links will be detected by automod, but you will get rid of some of them.


**Invite Rewards Servers**

> If you found an invite rewards server, there are 99.9% chances to be a scam.

**Malware & Token Stealers**

> These DMs are partially human-operated, some are automatic but some aren't and target users are often people with badges & moderators of large servers (their account can be used later). Always scan files using [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com), [urlscan.io](https://urlscan.io), [filescan.io](https://www.filescan.io/scan), etc. before executing them.
