**Loading Image Scam**

> How does it work? The attack, in fact, works in a much more simple way than many people imagine. Like all phishing attacks it eventually relies on you, the user, believeing that you are accessing a site you’re not. The attack works as follows:
> 
> A user posts a link to an image in a server.
> 
> The image displays a never-ending loading indicator.
> 
> The user clicks on the image, and clicks to open it in their browser.
> 
> The user is redirected to a phishing page.

**Invite Rewards Servers**

**Malware & Token Stealers**

> These DMs are partially human-operated, some are automatic but some aren't. Chances are you have seen this kind of scam. Target users are often people with badges & moderators of large servers (their account can be used later). Always scan files using [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com), [urlscan.io](https://urlscan.io), [filescan.io](https://www.filescan.io/scan), etc. before executing them.
